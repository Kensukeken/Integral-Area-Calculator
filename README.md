# Introductions

Welcome to my C++ Program! <br/>
This C++ program calculates the integral of a function over a given interval using numerical methods. It utilizes the following components:

- `calculateIntegral`: A function that calculates the integral using the provided lower bound `a`, upper bound `b`, and the number of intervals `numIntervals`. <br> <br>
 - By integrating `y = f(x)` between the limits of `a` and `b`, we may determine the area under the curve `y = f(x)` between `x = a` and `x = b`.

## Questions Of The Integral Area ##
### What is integral area?

**`Integral Area:`** The integral area refers to the area under a curve obtained by evaluating a definite integral. It represents the total enclosed area between the curve, the x-axis, and the interval of integration. The integral area can be positive or negative depending on the function's behavior within the interval. Integration techniques are used to calculate the integral area, which quantifies quantities such as displacement, value, or change associated with the function or process being modeled.
### Who invented integral area?

The concept of integral area was developed by Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century.

## What is it used for?

The integral area has various applications, including calculating areas, quantifying physical quantities, solving differential equations, probability and statistics, optimization problems, and applications in physics and engineering. Additionally, it plays a fundamental role in the development of calculus and mathematical analysis.
late average values of functions in various fields.
### Example: Calculating Work
For instance, consider a force `F(x)` applied to an object moving along the `x-axis` from `x = a` to `x = b`. The work done by the force can be calculated using the integral area as follows: <br/>

### Rule: Trapezoidal Rule

- The integral area, we divide the interval `[a, b]` into smaller subintervals, evaluate the function at the endpoints and intermediate points,
and sum up the corresponding areas of trapezoids. <br>

- The Trapezoidal Rule provides a numerical approach to estimate integrals
when obtaining an exact solution is challenging. <br/>
